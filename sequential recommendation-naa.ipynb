    "The proposed method is an extension of the average aggregation approach, with a dynamic adjustment based on individual user satisfaction scores. The key idea is to give more weight to the preferences of users who are less satisfied in the previous iteration while still considering the opinions of all group members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "Start with an initial recommendation list based on the average or least misery method.\n",
    "Assign equal weights to all group members initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration:\n",
    "Calculate individual user satisfaction scores based on their feedback from the previous recommendation.\n",
    "Adjust the weights for the next iteration based on satisfaction scores. Users with lower satisfaction scores receive higher weights.\n",
    "Recalculate the group recommendation using the weighted average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Adjustment:\n",
    "Adjust the weights dynamically in each iteration based on the satisfaction scores from the previous iteration.\n",
    "Users with higher satisfaction scores get lower weights in the next iteration, promoting diversity and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence Criteria:\n",
    "Monitor the convergence of the recommendation list. If the difference in satisfaction scores across group members is within a predefined threshold, consider the recommendations converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality and Inclusion:\n",
    "The method maintains the equality aspect by initially giving equal weights to all group members.\n",
    "It ensures inclusion of all opinions by adjusting weights dynamically, preventing domination by a subset of highly satisfied users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing Fairness:\n",
    "The dynamic adjustment of weights addresses the NP-Hard problem of minimizing the gap between the least and highest satisfied group members.\n",
    "By giving more weight to less satisfied users, the method aims to balance satisfaction levels across the entire group over multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptability:\n",
    "The method is adaptable to the changing preferences of users over time. It responds to shifts in satisfaction by adjusting weights in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence Control:\n",
    "The convergence criteria prevent excessive iterations and ensure stability in the recommendation list. Once satisfaction differences are sufficiently small, further iterations may not significantly impact the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight Adjustment Formula:\n",
    "Weight_i = BaseWeight / Satisfaction_i\n",
    "BaseWeight is the initial equal weight assigned to all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence Criteria:\n",
    "Monitor the standard deviation or range of satisfaction scores across group members. If it falls below a threshold, consider the recommendations converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterations:\n",
    "Run multiple iterations until convergence is achieved or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method leverages the strengths of average and least misery aggregation while addressing their drawbacks through dynamic weight adjustment. It aims to provide sequential group recommendations that are fair, inclusive, and responsive to individual user satisfaction."
